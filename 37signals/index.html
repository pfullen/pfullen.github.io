<h2> We built the company that we’d want to do business with. We hope you do too. </h2>


 <article class="column">
  <div class="blurb">
   <h3> 1 </h3>
	 <h4>  Useful is forever</h4>
	 <p>	Bells and whistles wear off, but 
			usefulness never does. We build useful software 
			that does just what you need and nothing you don’t. </p>
	</div>
	

	<div class="blurb">
	   <h3> 2 </h3>
	<h4> Great service is everything </h4>
			<p>We’re famous for fast and friendly customer service. 
			We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day.
			 See how our customers rate our service.
    </p>
	</div>	
	
	
	<div class="blurb">
	
	   <h3> 3 </h3>
	<h4> Clarity is king</h4>
			<p>Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have 
			no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
	
	</p>
	
	</div>	
	
	<div class="blurb">	
	   <h3> 4 </h3>
  <h4>  Our customers are our investors</h4>
			<p>Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. 
			We answer to them — not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.

<article class="column">
  <div class="blurb">
   <h3> 5 </h3>
	 <h4>  The basics are beautiful</h4>
	 <p>	We’ll never overlook what really matters:
	  The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing,
	   and respect for our customer’s time, money, and trust. </p>
	</div>
	

	<div class="blurb">
	   <h3> 6 </h3>
	<h4> No hidden fees or secret prices </h4>
			<p>We believe everyone is entitled to the best 
			price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right 
			on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
    </p>
	</div>	
	
	
	<div class="blurb">
	
	   <h3> 7 </h3>
	<h4> Software should be easy</h4>
			<p>Our products are intuitive. 
			You’ll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. 
			We don’t sell you training because you don’t need it.
	
	</p>
	
	</div>	
	
	<div class="blurb">	
	   <h3> 8 </h3>
  <h4>  Long-term contracts are obscene</h4>
			<p>No one likes being locked into something they 
			don’t want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time,
			 no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
